# Form Validation
* Open *html-forms.html* and *form-process.php* in an code editor.
* Some simple form processing has been set up already. Make sure it works. View *html-forms.html* through a browser (it must be on a server). Enter something for the email address and hit submit. The data you entered should be displayed.
* Answer the questions in *form-process.php*.
